Running the programs:
All the programs will run offline, and no other programs need to be executed first to make them work, but I recommend testing them online on my website, particularly for properly testing the programs built to work both online and offline.

Early deliverable - Hello World: http://dylanmaryk.com/offlinemaps/helloworld/
- After accessing this page while online, go offline and refresh it.

Early deliverable - TODO: http://dylanmaryk.com/offlinemaps/todo/
- NOTE: This deliverable is not intended to work offline.
- After typing any text in the text box, press the Enter key to add the text as a task to the list.
- Click the checkbox to mark the task as completed. Refresh the page. The task and ticked checkbox will remain present.
- Add as many tasks as you like, check/uncheck them, refresh the page etc.

Early deliverable - Raw Data: http://dylanmaryk.com/offlinemaps/rawdata/
- NOTE: This deliverable is not intended to work offline.
- Wait 10 seconds or so for the data to load.

Main project: http://dylanmaryk.com/offlinemaps/main/
- NOTE: The vector data (blue pins on the map) only works on the online version.
- After accessing this page while online, scroll around the map a bit, zoom in and out a bit, then refresh it.
- Any tiles and data that was loaded while online is now viewable offline.
