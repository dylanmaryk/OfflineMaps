The HTML5 application cache provides a simple means by which to locally store the files required to display a website offline automatically, whenever the user loads the page while they are online, ensuring the cached files are updated as frequently as possible. However, it is important to note for the further development of the project that browsers can have different size limits for cached data (http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_app_cache.asp), hence it is preferable to cache only the minimum necessary to display what it makes sense to be viewable offline. The bulk of data storage will likely be done using technologies such as indexedDBs, which I will investigate and implement later on.
